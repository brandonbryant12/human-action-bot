Calculation in the Socialist Society (London, 1949), pp. 129 ff. 11. Cf. H. D. Dickinson, Economics of Socialism (Oxford, 1939), p. 191. 12. For an analysis of the scheme of a corporative state see below, pp. 816-820. 13. Supply means a total inventory in which the whole supply available is specified in classes and quantities. Each class comprehends only such items as have in any regard (for instance, also in regard to their location) precisely the same importance for want-satisfaction. 14. Of course, we may assume that T 1 is equal to T n if we are prepared to imply that technological knowledge has reached its final stage. 15. With regard to this algebraic problem, cf. Pareto, Manuel d’économie politique (2d ed. Paris, 1927), pp. 233 f.; and Hayek, Collectivist Economic Planning (London, 1935), pp. 207-214.—Therefore the construction of electronic computers does not affect our problem.
