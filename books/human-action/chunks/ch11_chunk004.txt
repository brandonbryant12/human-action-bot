Cf., e.g., Eugen von Bergmann, Geschichte der nationalökonomischen Krisentheorien (Stuttgart, 1895). 28. For a critical analysis and refutation of Fisher’s argument, cf. Mises, The Theory of Money and Credit, trans. by H. E. Batson (London, 1934), pp. 42-44; for the same with regard to Wieser’s argument, Mises, Nationalökonomie (Geneva, 1940), pp. 192-194. 29. Cf. Friedrich von Wieser, Der natürliche Wert (Vienna, 1889), p. 60, n. 3. 30. Cf. A. Eddington, The Philosophy of Physical Science, pp. 70-79, 168-169. FIRST 42 LAST Categories: Ludwig von Mises
