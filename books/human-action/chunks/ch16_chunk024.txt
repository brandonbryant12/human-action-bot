See below, pp. 680-681. 67. See above, p. 366. 68. Cf. A Marshall, Principles of Economics (8th ed. London, 1930), pp. 124-127. 69. Cf. above, pp. 133-135. 70. In order not to confuse the reader by the introduction of too many new terms, we shall keep to the widespread usage of calling such fiats prices, interest rates, wage rates decreed and enforced by governments or other agencies of compulsion (e.g., labor unions). But one must never lose sight of the fundamental difference between the market phenomena of prices, wages, and interest rates on the one hand, and the legal phenomena of maximum or minimum prices, wages, and interest rates, designed to nullify these market phenomena, on the other hand.
