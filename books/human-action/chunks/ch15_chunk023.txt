opposed to the nature given or original factors of production, i.e., natural resources (land) and human labor. This terminology must be used with great caution as it can be easily misinterpreted and lead to the erroneous concept of real capital criticized below. 18. But, of course, no harm can result if, following the customary terminology, one occasionally adopts for the sake of simplicity the terms “capital accumulation” (or “supply of capital,” “capital shortage,” etc.) for the terms “accumulation of capital goods,” “supply of capital goods,” etc. 19. For this man these goods are not goods of the first order, but goods of a higher order, factors of further production. 20. Cf. e.g., R. v. Strigl, Kapital und Produktion (Vienna, 1934), p. 3. 21. Cf. Frank A. Fetter in Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences. III. 190. 22. Cf. below, pp. 526-534. 23. For an examination of the Russian “experiment” see Mises, Planned Chaos (Irvington-on-Hudson, NY, 1947), pp. 80-87 (reprinted in the new edition of Mises, Socialism [New Haven, 1951] pp. 527-592). 24. The most amazing product of this widespread mode of thought is the book of a Prussian professor, Bernhard Laum ( Die geschlossene Wirtschaft [Tübingen, 1933]). Laurn assembles a vast collection of quotations from ethnographical writings showing that many primitive tribes considered economic autarky as natural, necessary, and morally good. He concludes from this that autarky is the natural and most expedient state of economic management and that the return to autarky which he advocates is “a biologically necessary process.” (p. 491). 25. Guy de Maupassant analyzed Flaubert’s alleged hatred of the bourgeois in Etude sur Gustave Flaubert (reprinted in Oeuvres complètes de Gustave Flaubert [Paris, 1885], Vol. VII). Flaubert, says Maupassant, “aimait le monde” (p. 67); that is, he liked to move in the circle of Paris society composed of aristocrats, wealthy bourgeois, and the élite of artists, writers, philosophers, scientists, statesmen, and entrepreneurs (promoters). He used the term bourgeois as synonymous with imbecility and defined it this way: “I call a bourgeois whoever has mean thoughts ( pense bassement ).” Hence it is obvious that in employing the term bourgeois Flaubert did not have in mind the bourgeoisie as a social class, but a kind of imbecility he most frequently found in this class. He was full of contempt for the common man (” le bon peuple “) as well. However, as he had more frequent contacts with the ” gens du monde ” than with workers, the stupidity of the former annoyed him more than that of the latter (p. 59). These observations of Maupassant held good not only for Flaubert, but for the “anti-bourgeois” sentiments of all artists. Incidentally, it must be emphasized that from a Marxian point of view Flaubert is a “bourgeois” writer and his novels are an “ideological superstructure” of the “capitalist or bourgeois mode of production.” 26. The Nazis used “Jewish” as a synonym of both “capitalist” and “bourgeois.” 27. Cf. above, pp. 80-84. 28. Cf. Frank A. Fetter, The Principles of Economics (3d ed. New York, 1913), pp. 394, 410. 29. Beatrice Webb, Lady Passfield, herself the daughter of a wealthy businessman, may be quoted as an outstanding example of this mentality. Cf. My Apprenticeship (New York, 1926), p. 42. 30. Cf. Trotsky (1937) as quoted by Hayek, The Road to Serfdom (London, 1944), p. 89. 31. For a refutation of the fashionable doctrines of imperfect and of monopolistic competition cf. F. A. Hayek, Individualism and Economic Order (Chicago, 1948), pp. 92-118. 32. See below, p. 685. 33. See below, pp. 598-600. 34. In the political sphere resistance to oppression on the part of the established government is the ultima ratio of those oppressed. However illegal and unbearable the oppression, however lofty and noble the motives of the rebels, and however beneficial the consequences of their violent resistance, a revolution is always an illegal act, disintegrating the established order of state and government. It is an essential mark of civil government that it is in its territory the only agency which is in a position to resort to measures of violence or to declare legitimate whatever violence is practiced by other agencies. A revolution is an act of warfare between the citizens, it abolishes the very foundations of legality and is at best restrained by the questionable international customs concerning belligerency. If victorious, it can afterwards establish a new legal order and a new government. But it can never enact a legal “right to resist oppression.” Such an impunity granted to people venturing armed resistance to the armed forces of the government is tantamount to anarchy and incompatible with any mode of government. The Constituent Assembly of the first French Revolution was foolish enough to decree such a right; but it was not so foolish as to take its own decree seriously. 35. If an action neither improves nor impairs the state of satisfaction, it still involves a psychic loss because of the uselessness of the expended psychic effort. The individual concerned would have been better off if he had inertly enjoyed life. 36. Cf. Mangoldt, Die Lehre vom Unternehmergewinn (Leipzig, 1855), p. 82. The fact that out of 100 liters of plain wine one cannot produce 100 liters of champagne, but a smaller quantity, has the same significance as the fact that 100 kilograms of sugar beet do not yield 100 kilograms of sugar but a smaller quantity. 37. Cf. Knight, Risk, Uncertainty and Profit (Boston, 1921), pp. 211-213. 38. If we were to apply the faulty concept of a “national income” as used in popular speech, we would have to say that no part of national income goes into profits. 39. The problem of the convertibility of capital goods is dealt with below, pp. 503-505. 40. Cf. below, pp. 769-779. 41. Cf. below, pp. 812-820. 42. For a detailed treatment of the problems involved, cf. Mises, Bureaucracy (New Haven, 1944). 43. Cf. Chamberlin, The Theory of Monopolistic Competition (Cambridge, Mass., 1935), pp. 123 ff. FIRST 42 LAST Categories: Ludwig von Mises
